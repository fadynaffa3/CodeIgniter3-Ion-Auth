#Ion Auth 2 With codeigniter 3 and bootstrap

## add helpers and libraries in autoload ##

###The future of authentication
by [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com)

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean,
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.  So we refactored
the code and added new features.

This version drops any backwards compatibility and makes things even more
awesome then you could expect.

##Documentation
Documentation is located at http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/

##Installation
Just copy the files from this package to the corresponding folder in your
application folder.  For example, copy Ion_auth/config/ion_auth.php to
application/config/ion_auth.php.


###Relational DB Setup

go to url yourapp/rake/migrate and the migration file will be installed by itself


###Default Login
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password


###Important
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


###Optimization
It is recommended that you add your identity column as a unique index.



Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.
